        <h1>Chicken</h1>

        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl,
            originally
            from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
            junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds,
            and a
            younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is
            called
            a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which
            is
            still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        <p>
            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
            There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language
            and
            literature.

        <p>
            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
            East
            Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
            subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient
            Egypt
            in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between
            Syria
            and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece
            from
            the 5th century BC.[7][8]

        <h2>terminology</h2>
        <p>
            An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster, and an adult female is called a
            hen.[9][10]

            Other terms are:

            Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]
            Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
            Chick: a young chicken[13]
            Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]
            Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
            Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]
            Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
            immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
            Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
            Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally
            a
            term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and
            scientific contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

            In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species (e.g. "a cooked
            chook"
            or "she keeps chooks"); which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently
            hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b"
            viz.
            the young of any bird.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
            century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is
            widely
            used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]
        </p>

        <h2>Biology & Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
            even
            animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

            The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken
            lived
            for 16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]

            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny,
            pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder
            colours
            than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster
            has
            only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at
            the
            comb, or eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids,
            the
            male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).

            Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
            either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head
            and
            throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds,
            these
            are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds that causes
            extra
            feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]

            Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable
            of
            flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens
            may
            occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
        </p>

        <h2>Behaviour</h2>
        <h3>Social behaviour</h3>
        <p>
            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
            of
            eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking
            order,
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters
            from
            a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
            hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]

            Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one credible report exists
            of a
            young fox killed by hens.[32][33][34] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may
            puff
            up its feathers.[35]
        </p>

        <h2>Vocalization</h2>
        <P>
            When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch
            as
            well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
            chicks and encourage them to eat.

            A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
            roosters.[36]
            However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

            Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning
            calls
            when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[37]

        <h2>Crowing</h2>
        <p>
            "Cockadoodledoo" and "Cocka-doodle-doo" redirect here. For the nursery rhyme, see Cock a doodle doo.

            Bergische Kräher crowing
            Duration: 8 seconds.0:08
            The long crowing of a Bergische Kräher
            Duration: 6 seconds.0:06
            Normal length crowing (with audio). Long-crowing chickens have a longer crow.
            Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as
            well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[citation
            needed]

            Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands,
            Belgium,[38] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with longcrowers.
            Depending on
            the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is
            measured.
        </p>

        <h2>Courtship</h2>
        <p>
            To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often
            lowering
            the wing which is closest to the hen.[39] The dance triggers a response in the hen[39] and when she responds
            to
            his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.

            More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:

            Male approaching the hen
            Male pre-copulatory waltzing
            Male waltzing
            Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)
            Male mounting
            Male treading with both feet on hen's back
            Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[40]
